## Match System

### Match Statuses

**Pending** → Match created but tournament not started  
**Ready** → Tournament started, waiting for veto or server  
**Loaded** → On server, warmup mode, players connecting  
**Live** → Match in progress, rounds being played  
**Completed** → Winner determined, bracket updated

### Intelligent Match Status Messages

The system shows context-aware status messages:

| Status | Condition | Message |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Pending | Tournament not started | "Waiting for tournament to start..." |
| Ready | Veto not complete | "Teams voting for maps..." |
| Ready | Veto complete | "Veto complete - Waiting for server..." |
| Loaded | 0 players | "Server ready - Waiting for players (0/10)" |
| Loaded | Some players | "Waiting for players (3/10)" |
| Loaded | All players | "All players connected - Waiting for ready up" |
| Live | - | "Match in progress" |

## Server Management

2. Allocates server to match
3. Generates match config with teams and maps
4. Sends RCON: `matchzy_loadmatch_url "http://api/matches/{slug}.json"`
5. Configures webhook: `matchzy_remote_log_url "http://api/events/{slug}"`
6. Configures demo upload
7. Match goes to warmup

**All automatic!**

### Server Status Monitoring

- **RCON Heartbeat:** Periodic status checks
- **Match Tracking:** Which match is on which server
- **Auto-Config:** Webhook configured on status check
