- 🔄 Match status changes (pending → ready → loaded → live → completed)
- 🔄 Players connect/disconnect
- 🔄 Players ready/unready
- 🔄 Veto actions happen (ban, pick, side selection)
- 🔄 Tournament state changes (starts, completes)

## Server Management

### Auto Server Allocation

When tournament starts or veto completes:

1. System attempts to find available servers (online + not in use)
2. **If server available:** Allocates immediately
3. **If no server available:** Backend polls every 10 seconds for available servers
4. Allocates server to match when found
5. Generates match config with teams and maps
6. Sends RCON: `matchzy_loadmatch_url "http://api/matches/{slug}.json"`
7. Configures webhook: `matchzy_remote_log_url "http://api/events/{slug}"`
8. Configures demo upload
9. Match goes to warmup
10. Updates sent via WebSocket — teams see server info automatically

!!! tip "Waiting for Server"
If all servers are busy, matches show "WAITING FOR SERVER" status. The system automatically checks every 10 seconds and assigns servers as they become available. No manual intervention needed!

**All automatic!**

### Server Status Monitoring

- **RCON Heartbeat:** Periodic status checks
- **Match Tracking:** Which match is on which server
- **Auto-Config:** Webhook configured on status check
