> **Haven't set up your CS2 server yet?** See the [CS2 Server Setup Guide](server-setup.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## Add Your First Server

Add your configured CS2 server to the system:

1. Go to **Admin Tools** → **Servers**
2. Click **"Add Server"**
3. Fill in:
   ```
   Name: My Server 1

   Port: 27015
   RCON Password: <your-rcon-password>
   ```
