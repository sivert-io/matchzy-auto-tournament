# Verifying Demo Uploads

This guide explains how to verify that demo uploads are working correctly in the MatchZy Auto Tournament system.

## Overview

MatchZy automatically uploads demo files after matches complete. The system receives these uploads via the `/api/demos/:matchSlug/upload` endpoint and stores them in `data/demos/{matchSlug}/`.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Demo Upload Configuration

Before a match starts, verify that demo upload is configured:

**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/demos/:matchSlug/status`

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/demos/r1m1/status
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "matchSlug": "r1m1",
  "matchId": 1,
  "serverId": "server-123",
  "matchStatus": "loaded",
  "demoUploadConfigured": true,
  "expectedUploadUrl": "https://your-domain.com/api/demos/r1m1/upload",
  "hasDemoFile": false,
  "demoFilePath": null,
  "note": "MatchZy should upload demos to the expected URL after match/map completion"
}
```

**What to check:**

- ✅ `demoUploadConfigured` should be `true`
- ✅ `expectedUploadUrl` should be a valid URL
- ⚠️ If `demoUploadConfigured` is `false`, check that `webhook_url` is set in settings

### 2. Verify Demo Upload Command Was Sent

When a match is loaded, check the logs for:

```
✓ Demo upload configured for match r1m1 on server-123
```

Or check the match load response:

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/matches/:slug/load`

The response includes:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "demoUploadConfigured": true,
  "rconResponses": [
    {
      "success": true,
      "command": "matchzy_demo_upload_url \"https://your-domain.com/api/demos/r1m1/upload\""
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Monitor Demo Upload Logs

Watch the application logs during and after a match. You should see:

**When upload starts:**

```
[Demo Upload] Upload request received
  matchSlug: r1m1
  filename: match_demo.dem
  matchId: 12345
  mapNumber: 1
```

**When upload completes:**

```
[Demo Upload] Demo uploaded successfully
  matchSlug: r1m1
  filename: match_demo.dem
  fileSize: 15.23 MB
  path: r1m1/match_demo.dem
```

### 4. Check Demo File Exists

After a match completes, verify the demo file was saved:

**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/demos/:matchSlug/info`

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/demos/r1m1/info
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "hasDemo": true,
  "filename": "match_demo.dem",
  "size": 15972352,
  "sizeFormatted": "15.23 MB"
}
```

**Or check the file system:**

```bash
ls -lh data/demos/r1m1/
# Should show .dem files
```

### 5. Download Demo File

Test downloading the demo:

**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/demos/:matchSlug/download`

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -o demo.dem \
  http://localhost:3000/api/demos/r1m1/download
```

## Troubleshooting

### Demo Upload Not Configured

**Symptoms:**

- `demoUploadConfigured: false` in status endpoint
- No demo upload command in logs

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure `webhook_url` is set in Settings
2. Verify `SERVER_TOKEN` environment variable is set
3. Check that the match was loaded after webhook URL was configured

### Demo Upload Fails

**Symptoms:**

- Logs show "Failed to configure demo upload"
- MatchZy server logs show errors

**Solutions:**

1. Verify RCON connection to server is working
2. Check MatchZy plugin version (0.8.24+)
3. Ensure server can reach the webhook URL (not localhost)
4. Check server logs for MatchZy errors

### Demo File Not Received

**Symptoms:**

- Match completes but no demo file
- Status shows `hasDemoFile: false`

**Solutions:**

1. Check MatchZy server logs for upload errors
2. Verify the upload URL is accessible from the server
3. Check that `SERVER_TOKEN` matches in both systems
4. Verify MatchZy has permission to write demos
5. Check application logs for upload errors

### Demo Upload Received But File Missing

**Symptoms:**

- Logs show "Demo uploaded successfully"
- But file doesn't exist on disk

**Solutions:**

1. Check disk space: `df -h`
2. Verify write permissions on `data/demos/` directory
3. Check application logs for file write errors
4. Verify the file path is correct

## Testing Demo Upload Manually

You can test the demo upload endpoint manually using curl:

```bash
# Create a dummy demo file
echo "dummy demo content" > test.dem

# Upload it (requires SERVER_TOKEN)
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-MatchZy-Token: YOUR_SERVER_TOKEN" \
  -H "MatchZy-FileName: test_demo.dem" \
  -H "MatchZy-MatchId: 12345" \
  -H "MatchZy-MapNumber: 1" \
  --data-binary @test.dem \
  http://localhost:3000/api/demos/r1m1/upload
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Demo uploaded successfully",
  "filename": "test_demo.dem"
}
```

## Log Locations

- **Application logs:** Check console output or log files
- **MatchZy server logs:** Check CS2 server console/logs
- **Demo files:** `data/demos/{matchSlug}/`
